Python Lesson #3:

Control Structures:

# if statements, for loops, while loops

# an if statement is going to control an action associated with a truth value

# if __thing that is true___, do this action


# lets create a variable

my_class_greeting = 'hello class!'

if my_class_greeting == 'hello class!':
	print('hi!!')

#an option that is not true:
if my_class_greeting == 'hi class':
	print('hi!')

# WHILE LOOPS:
# if the thing is true:
# do the action
# as long as the thing is true:
# continue doing the action
# if the tthing is false:
#please stop the action

# initialize this variable my_response as an empty string
my_response = ''

# start a while loop 
# using an input function call:

while my_response != 'please stop':
	print('hey whats up happy friday')
